title:  Reviewer First Pull Requests
classes: wide
---

Pull requests continue to be the primary mechanism by which we collaborate and contribute code.
Despite this we often will put as little effort as possible into creating PRs. I'd like to convince
you that even a small investment in improving them pays oversized dividends to the project and your
team members.

# Background

I'll start by admitting that because the PR is frequently at the very end of a development effort
that we should pay respect to the mental exhaustion present. A project spike will start with a
mountain of known unknowns, and some unknown unknowns as well, all of which an IC will be
accountable for, in addition to writing code that is maintainable, tested, and covers edge cases. It
can be exhausting and therefore understandable that we would feel the impulse to create the PR as
quickly as possible to get this over the finish line. I hope you'll agree that by the end of this
post that spending a bit more effort to create a better PR is worth it, and is probably not as much
effort as one might think.

Let's start with the perspective of the reviewer. Everyone is familiar with this scenario: you get
an notification about a new PR you need to review. You open the PR and see that the title of the PR
is a JIRA ticket. The description of the PR is blank. You find the JIRA ticket and read it to get
some context before continuing. Going back to the PR, you see about forty commits, many of which are
things like "migration" or "wtf please work" or worse. Given this you click the "Files changed" tab
and see that there are 5k lines of code changed, across 30 files. Resigned to your fate, you then
try to understand this large changeset all at once. Because it's incredibly difficult to do so and
because you are also under the gun for your own changesets, you end up reviewing it at the surface
level and your review mostly consists of style feedback, and perhaps some more nuanced feedback for
the parts you are able to understand more easily.

> This is clearly not the experience we want.

As the creator of the PR, you are hoping to merge it. But past that, you also want your teammates to
let you know of things that you may not have considered, or why this particular algorithm you've
employed may have negative effects on the backend APIs it eventually calls. Style nits are OK but
avoiding an incident by pointing out an unhandled edge case is much better.

The reviewers only have so much time to devote to your PR. If that time is largely spent being
mystified about the changeset, that is time that they are not spending giving you the quality
feedback you should be hoping for. The time a reviewer spends on any particular PR is then
multiplied by the number of people that end up reviewing it.

> Time spent creating a better PR costs the business less to merge it.

# RFPR Overview

Reviewer First Pull Requests (RFPRs) are a prescriptive approach to building better PRs that are
cheaper to review. At Mesosphere I worked on a team under [Kevin
Klues](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klueska). After creating a PR which was hard to review he
convinced me that his "Reviewer-First" methodology was worth adopting, and I've been promoting it
ever since.

> At the heart of RFPRs is the concept that PRs, like a book, should tell a story.

When reading a book, you typically know what it's about before you start because you've read the
intro on the back. You start at the first chapter, and continue reading until the end. Even if the
book was particularly long or complex, the chapters were structured in a way to guide you through
the story that the author wanted to tell.

RFPRs operate under the same principle. A reviewer should be able to open the PR and read the
description to get a good idea for what the PR is addressing and what to expect inside. RFPRs are
structured so that they can be reviewed commit-by-commit, in order, leaving feedback as they go.

> Large or complex PRs are made more approachable if the author guides the reviewers.

# RFPR Guidelines

Following are guidelines for creating RFPRs. Afterwards we'll discuss some tooling that will make
following the guidelines much easier.

## PR titles

PR titles should describe what the PR accomplishes.

Examples of good PR titles:

- [CONTROL_42] Expose gRPC endpoints for all controlplane APIs.
- kafka: Create new topic for user events and enable mirrormaker for all regions.
- Modify CMS domain models to use composition instead of inheritance.

PR titles which should be avoided:

- [CONTROL_42] (just a JIRA ticket number)
- fix bug
- (nothing)

Imagine that you are trying to find a particular PR on GitHub during an incident. The PR title
should be descriptive enough so that it can be easily identified.

## PR descriptions

The PR description sets the stage for the reviewer. Since they are going to review the PR
commit-by-commit, the description should give them as much context as possible before they start.
Assume that the reviewer does not have the context that you do.

The description should roughly include these components:

1. Links to tickets or other prior art.
2. Overview of the problem or business goal.
3. Description of your approach.
4. Callouts to any parts which are complex or about which you are hoping for extra feedback.
5. Edge cases and risks.

It's worth noting that PRs which are small in scope will have a correspondingly smaller PR
description. PRs which are large or complex will have a larger PR description. This is largely
subjective, and at first I think it might feel like it's unnecessary work, but that is temporary. In
fact I've found that by writing a detailed description, I will sometimes remember things I had
forgotten to address during development. By writing the description *for the reviewer* this causes
you to think about the things that the reviewer would probably have questions about. Anything you
catch at this phase is a major win, as it is a short amount of time compared to the revisions to the
PR which would otherwise follow.

Code snippets (for example, to showcase a new interface you are adding) are often really helpful in
the description.

## Commits

The reviewer should expect to review your PR in commit order. What order should the commits be in
and what should the commits contain? Remember that we are assuming that the reviewer is coming in
fresh and probably does not have the familiarity with the code that you do.

In general I try to isolate what I consider to be "high value" and "low value" changes in separate
commits. A high value commit would be something like adding a new trait, or implementing that
trait for a number of domain models. Low value commits would be things like formatting, or code
imports. To make it as easy as possible on the reviewer, allow them to briefly consider low value
changes and spend more time on the high value changes.

> Do not mix high value and low value changes in the same commits.

Since the reviewer is reading in commit order, we should also strive to limit the scope of any
particular commit. If your PR is adding and implementing five interfaces to all of the domain
models, a reasonable approach would be to have each interface, and the implementation of that
interface, be in its own commit. If you're sweating now because you're not comfortable with Git,
don't worry -- we'll talk later about tools you can use to build these kinds of commits.

Guidelines for good commits:

1. Commits should be limited in scope.
2. Do not mix high value and low value concerns in the same commit.
3. Commit message titles should be a sentence that describes an action.
4. Commit messages should end with a period.
5. Commit descriptions should discuss that commit's changes as necessary.

Here's an example of a medium-sized PR that follows these guidelines:

    Set ECS Attribute to indicate health of ledger latency

    JIRA: F8N-365

    # Overview

    This is the first step of a longer term goal to be able to control the behavior of ECS task
    placement for tasks which rely on this database. The idea is that if the task requires a healthy
    ledger latency we can avoid placing it on a node which is behind.

    # Approach

    This PR adds some new behavior to the reflectors. The reflectors will start a ledger latency
    monitor when they start. This monitor will periodically look at the ledger latency as reported
    by the db client. If below a max threshold, it will ensure that the container instance on which
    it runs has an ECS attribute to indicate the ledger has fallen behind.

    # Next Steps

    After this is deployed and working we should spot check new instances to ensure that they are
    not marked as 'healthy' if they are still working on updating the ledger. Once we are confident
    in this, we can then update our deployment tooling to lean on this new attribute.

The commits on this PR try to follow RFPR guidelines. Notice how low value and high value changes
are isolated:

    * Move loop helper code to pkg/loop.
    * Add ECS dependencies.
    * Update executive interface mock.
    * Create an ECSClient interface and generate mock.
    * Create EcsMetada type to unmarshal ECS metadata.
    * Create ledger monitor to set ECS 'unhealthy' attribute when falling behind.
    * Add functional options for the Monitor.
    * Update reflector config to also compose ledger health config.
    * Add tests to verify attribute is set correctly using a mocked ECS environment.

Example of what I consider to be a reasonable commit within this PR.

    Create ledger monitor to set ECS 'unhealthy' attribute when falling behind.

    The monitor follows the pattern that the other types use, where a Start(ctx) method blocks, and
    only exits when the context is canceled.

    It follows this high level logic:

    * Every time the *time.Ticker ticks:
        * get the ledger latency from the db
        * compare this value to threshold
        * if latency is OK, set a 'healthy' attr
        * else set 'unhealthy' attr

    It keepds the last known successful ECS attr set in a local var so that it doesn't set the attr
    on each tick. The variable is a *bool because we need three states:

    1. unknown state of ECS attr
    2. 'healthy'
    3. 'unhealthy'


These are the kinds of PRs I'm thankful to get notified about. I might spend on average 15-30m extra
to create PRs using these guidelines, but it saves many hours across the reviewers assigned to it,
and the quality of feedback you get on your RFPR will invariably be higher.

# Tooling

Much of RFPRs ends up being a writing excercise -- writing your PR title, PR description, commit
titles, commit descriptions, with the reviewer in mind. But a large part of RFPRs involves commit
discipline. If you're like me, you really only know what the changeset is going to look like after
you finish making all of your changes. As I approach the finish line, my feature branch has tens if
not hundreds of garbage commits.

In fact I have a `ci` (checkin) script that enables these garbage commits. I love it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

msg="${*:-wip}"
git add -A
git commit -m "${msg}"
```

I use this constantly and so my feature branch is littered with `wip` commits. These are my
breadcrumbs that enable to me to "checkpoint" my progress in a way that doesn't take me out of the
flow. They also let me back out more granual changes -- maybe I wanted to see if a particular change
made sense. I `ci` before I start, and if I hate it, it's easy for me to throw away that change
without risk of throwing away what came before it.

A branch that looks like this is clearly not RFPR-ready. How then do we go from a feature branch
full of `wip` comments to something that is a RFPR? My strategy, which works for me, is to wait
until the very end to restructure my commits. The primary way I do this is by using `git reset` and
`lazygit`. Note that there are a lot of tools like this, and I encourage you to explore what is
right for you.

## git reset

Your feature branch (e.g. `collin/ecs-attr`) is meant to eventually merge into a base branch, which
is often `origin/main`. Our goal is to 1) keep all of our changes and 2) craft custom commits that
tell the story of our RFPR.

If you're not familiar with `git reset`, it probably sounds scary, but it's not actually destructive
in the way it sounds. Using `git reset --hard` IS destructive and should be used with care.`git
reset` will point your branch to whatever you reset it to, and any changes on your branch will be
moved into the working tree. The effect is that it is as-if you just created your feature branch on
top of `origin/main` and then made all of those changes. From there we can start building our
commits.

1. (on `collin/ecs-attr`): `git fetch; git merge origin/main`
2. (on `collin/ecs-attr`): `git reset origin/main`
3. Build commits

All of our changes have now been unstaged and it is up to us to build our commits.

I like to start with the lightweight concerns. If you have some documentation changes, add those
files into a commit. If your feature required modifying some other things to support it, adding
commits for those updates would be reasonsable. After I'm done with the pre-requisites, I then add
commits for the changes which are at the heart of my PR. Following those are typically commits which
address testing. Finally, I usually save most of my formatting changes for one commit near the end
which reviewers can spend minimal time on since it should be a no-op.

Some commits are naturally scoped to whole files. For example, if you updated the README, then
adding the whole README file (`git add [file]`) and then making a commit is reasonable.

If your PR was introducing five new interfaces and implementations across your domain models, you'd
probably want each of those to be its own commit, but the model files they modify are the same ones.
You need some way to only add parts of each model file for the commit that adds one of the
interfaces. Similarly, how do you isolate formatting changes when those changes touch most of the
files? `lazygit`!

## lazygit

[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a terminal UI (TUI) that enables you to
easily perform Git actions that would otherwise be more difficult. This is a screenshot of my `blog`
repo which I use for this site:

![lazygit](/assets/images/lazygit.png)

It's organized into different pages, each of which has a different responsibility:

- changed files
- branches and remotes
- commit list
- stash
- changes diff

Using this interface, I will frequently:

- build commits for a RFPR after a `git reset` to the base branch.
- add individual lines across multiple files into a new or existing commit.
- reorder commits on a feature branch.
- amend a commit with a particular change.
- take a change out of a commit and create a new commit from it.
- ... and much more

This post does not intend to be a tutorial on how to use `lazygit`. You should start with the
[Tutorials](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#tutorials) to get a sense
for it. Getting a hang of the keybinds takes a short while, and then you can configure it to your
liking.

Believe me when I say that using a tool like this gives you a lot of power. So much so that when I
create a RFPR, I spend more time on writing the documentation for it than actually building the
commits using `lazygit` -- it's that good.

# Receiving Feedback

Once you've posted the RFPR and need to make followup commits, those commits should also be RFPR
comits. Other people will come back later and read through them and we should also respect their
time.

I would highly recommend *not* rebasing or rewriting commits after you start getting feedback. The
reason for this is that reordering the commits or amending them, ends up creating new commits under
the hood (even if `lazygit` made it super easy to do so). Because reviewers will leave feedback on
each commit during the initial review, if you rewrite that commit as a followup and force push, the
feedback they left becomes orphaned and out of context because that commit no longer exists.

For that reason, it's better to push new commits when addressing feedback, even if those changes
would normally be structured differently if you were creating the RFPR from scratch.

# Conclusion

I hope I've been able to convince you that RFPRs are worth the effort. Your teammates will thank you
for this and perhaps you can convince them to also write their own RFPRs!
